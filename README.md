# üçµ Tea Subscription Service Backend

## üìù Overview of Project and Goals

Tea Subscription Service is a Rails API that allows users to manage tea subscriptions, including creating, viewing, and canceling subscriptions. The project was designed to demonstrate a strong understanding of RESTful principles, API design, and data management with a focus on clean, scalable code and well-structured testing.

Goals of the project include:
	‚Ä¢	Building a Rails API to handle subscription data
	‚Ä¢	Creating endpoints for viewing, creating, and canceling subscriptions
	‚Ä¢	Managing many-to-many relationships between subscriptions, teas, and customers
	‚Ä¢	Following RESTful conventions and JSON:API specification
	‚Ä¢	Writing thorough request and model tests with RSpec

## üöÄ Set Up

	1.	Clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:[your-username]/Mod-3-Final-Project-BE.git

	2.	Navigate into the directory;

    cd Mod-3-Final-Project-BE
    
    3.	Install dependencies:

    bundle install

	4.	Set up the database

    5.	Run the server

    rails s

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used, Challenges, Wins & Reflections

Technologies Used:

	‚Ä¢	Backend: Ruby on Rails 

	‚Ä¢	Testing: RSpec, Faker, FactoryBot

	‚Ä¢	Serialization: jsonapi-serializer

	‚Ä¢	Database: PostgreSQL


Challenges Faced:

	‚Ä¢	Embedding related data directly under attributes in the JSON:API response

	‚Ä¢	Ensuring customers_subscribed updated dynamically after canceling subscriptions

	‚Ä¢	Managing strong params and custom controller actions

  Wins & Reflections:

‚úÖ Created RESTful endpoints with clean, consistent JSON responses

‚úÖ Successfully managed complex many-to-many relationships

‚úÖ Implemented thorough test coverage for models and requests
